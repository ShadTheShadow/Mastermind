🎮 Mastermind

Welcome to Mastermind, my recreation of one of my favorite childhood games! This version is built in C# using Photon for multiplayer functionality.

📖 About the Game

Mastermind is a two-player game where:

One player creates a secret code.

The other player guesses the code within a limited number of attempts.

Feedback is provided after each guess to help narrow down the possibilities.
